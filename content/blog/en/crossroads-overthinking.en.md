In this fairly short journey of life, we are all always faced with various kinds of challenges, and often we will be silent with such a messy mind, I usually refer to this condition as—being at a *crossroads*. I'm not the first person who came up with this sentence, I also don't know who the first person to mention that condition was with that sentence, but I agree with the *crossroads* word he said.

Let's forget for a moment about the originator, then what is the meaning of the word *crossroads*?

When I'm writing this, I'm at a *crossroads*. No! It's not the crossroads you're currently thinking of, but I'm in a condition where I'm silent and don't know which direction to turn in the journey of my life. Conditions like this happen very often, and of course it's not just me.

When we are at a *crossroads*, it is almost impossible for us not to experience *overthinking*. We will try to predict and grope the future. This condition makes many of us “stumble” and “bleed”. In fact, it's not uncommon for us to experience friction with those closest to us.

When the condition of *overthinking* is happening, anxiety and fear are the initial symptoms that we will experience, even anger will also haunt us from behind. This is of course very annoying, we will constantly look at our cellphones, slide the home screen back and forth, open and close social media many times, daydreaming, blaming ourselves, blaming others, stress, not focusing, and so on. Of course this condition is not a good thing for everyone.

I myself am the most difficult person to get out of *overthinking*, when excessive thoughts enter my head, I will constantly be immersed in those thoughts, adding a lot of possibilities to my head that are not necessarily the case, resulting in confusion with self and with others. This is what I mean by “stumble” and “bleeding”.

So what do we need to do when we are at an *crossroads*? And what should we do if *overthinking* is happening? I'm not a psychologist, so maybe my input and opinion on this is not perfect. I'm just sharing some of the things I've done when I was in this condition.

### When you are at a *crossroads*.

Usually I stay quiet and don't take the road in a hurry, I will try to identify myself, take a deep breath slowly, look around, remember what my original goal was, what I want to achieve, and try to chat with friends who understand what I am. existence. I think it's a good thing to do.

### When excessive thoughts arise constantly.

Usually I will try to be open with myself, telling myself that I am an ordinary human being, everything is certainly not perfect, there will be many possibilities that will happen to me, whatever it is, I will accept it wholeheartedly. Again, in this case, taking slow deep breaths is a very good thing, and learning to let go of unnecessary thoughts and directing myself with something tangible.

### When we are triggered by anger.

It's better not to make a decision quickly, I suggest holding your mouth to not utter a word. This is not an easy matter, because anger usually makes us want to vent our feelings through hurtful sentences, believe me it will not solve anything.

### Apologize & forgive.

Who needs to be forgiven? Yourself and others. When we are *overthinking* because of relationships with others, such as friends, family, or partners, you should learn to forgive and apologize first. Learn to apologize to yourself for overthinking things that didn't necessarily happen, and to forgive them first even if bad things haven't happened yet.

Once again, my input and opinion are not perfect, because everyone has different characteristics. If you don't find the right answer, it's a good idea to consult with a mentor or psychologist.

Stay healthy.
