Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

It's nice to get to know a lot of people, even though I'm actually an introvert ðŸ˜† But that's okay, because that doesn't mean I'm anti-social.

I am a `Graphic Designer`, `Front-End Web Developer`, `Author` & `Video Editor`. I have worked for 3 years as a Graphic Designer & Video Editor at a church in downtown Tangerang - Indonesia, and currently working as a Senior Graphic Designer for a company in South Jakarta (ID).

I have also studied websites for more than 5 years, and 4 years developing myself to become a writer. And I have a website [Poronesia.com](https://poronesia.com), creative design agency.

That is a glimpse of my work. Hopefully this brief and one-way introduction can represent the profile that I have.

If you are interested in contacting me about business or work, email me via the button at the bottom right of your screen.
